# 🧮 Quantari (QNTR)

**Quantari** is a transparent, community-respected SPL token launched on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the precision of ancient Chinese quants and the structured clarity of abacuses, Quantari was designed to stand apart from the noise of memecoins and pump-and-dump culture.

No false hype. No secret unlocks. No preloaded insiders. Just smart design and shared opportunity.

## 🔍 Philosophy

Quantari isn’t here to promise the world — it exists to **reward attention, participation, and real curiosity.**

We believe in "skin in the game" — a token should speak through code, not marketing slides. All allocations are transparent, and no DAO or opaque governance body is currently used.

Instead, decisions are tracked in this repo, and wallet actions can be verified publicly.

## 💼 Dev Expense Wallet

A designated wallet holds 8% of the supply for covering costs related to development, infrastructure, hardware, and tooling. This is not a payout — it’s a reinvestment into the project’s longevity.

If you appreciate the work or want to help fund future development, donations are welcome.

## 🔒 Governance & Treasury

Quantari does **not** operate under a DAO at this stage. Instead:

- A **transparent Treasury Reserve** (11%) is held for future contributors, experiments, and project tooling.
- No multi-sig overhead. No false promises of “DAO coming soon.”
- All allocations are visible and accountable.

Future decisions may shift toward community involvement if the need emerges organically.

## 🌐 Launch Process

All minting, contract deployment, and wallet actions are conducted publicly using CLI tools and this GitHub repo. The LP, airdrops, and other flows are planned via open scripts.

If you’d like to build around Quantari or contribute tooling, feel free to fork or submit PRs.
