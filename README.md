# 🧠 Quantari Token

Quantari is a fair-launch SPL token deployed on the Solana blockchain with **no presale, no VC funding, and no dev tax**. Every token was minted transparently and lives entirely in the hands of the public.

This project represents a new approach: **community-first, skin-in-the-game**, and radically simple.

## 🔑 Core Values

- **Fair Mint**  
  100 million tokens minted in a single transaction. No secret wallets. No team allocation. No VC backers.

- **No Presale / No Airdrop Promises**  
  No speculation. No dangling carrots. Participation is the only path.

- **Ownership by Action**  
  No central authority. No promises of future governance. If it matters, build it.

- **No Roadmap Theater**  
  No "soon." No buzzwords. No vapor. What you see is what exists — and what comes next is up to those who show up.

## 🧭 Community-First Ethos

Quantari draws quiet inspiration from the ancient Chinese quants — mathematicians and traders who moved beads on abacuses with intention, clarity, and discipline. In that same spirit, Quantari rejects hype in favor of signal, and leaves control in the hands of those willing to take responsibility.

This isn't just a token — it's a mirror. It reflects the actions of those who hold it.

There are no unlocks. No marketing team. No safety nets.

What happens next is earned, not given.

Use it. Fork it. Ignore it. It’s yours.
